## **What is this repository about ?**

This is a library of in memory data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. I had been investing a lot of time studying algorithms and data structures since some time now and hence wanted a way of sharing this with any one who might be interested. The repository by no means is at production level, but you can surely go ahead and try using it for your projects. The solutions are absolutely readable and easy to understand. I still work on this repository in my free time and try improving the current code base by adding new implementations or adding 
more utility functions to the existing ones.

Below is a list of what is already implemented. The list is not a comprehensive one but would enhance as I would be adding more over time.

####**_Data Structures -_**

1. Arrays and Lists
* DynamicArray - Self resizing arrays
* SinglyLinkedList
* DoublyLinkedList

2. Stacks  
* StackArray - Array based stack
* StackLinked - Linked List based stack

3. Queues
 * QueueArray - Array Based queue
 * DequeArray - **Not implemented yet**
  
4. Maps
 * BitMap
 * HashLinkedList - HashMap using separate chaining

5. Trees
 * BinarySearchTree
 * AVLTree
 * RedBlackTree

6. Tries
 * BasicTrie
 * EnhancedTrie (Read description in the code for knowing the differences)
 * TernarySearchTrie
  
7. DisjointSet

8. BloomFilter

####**_Algorithms - _**

  1. Pattern Matching
*  Naive Pattern Matching
*  KMP Search
*  Rabin Karp Algorithm
*  ZAlgorithm for Pattern Matching

  2. Sorting
* BubbleSort
* InsertionSort
* SelectionSort
* QuickSort
* MergeSort

  3. Hashing
* FNV
* Murmur3

I have not written all the code completely by myself and everything in the repository is a result of various other online resources 
that I have used for ideas and even implementations a few times. Please find a list of very very useful references below.

You might have very different views/suggestions about the choice and style of implementation, code and design. I would be happy to have ideas on improving the current code base ! Please feel free to file bugs or come up with design concerns. You can reach out at the following email address.
